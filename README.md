## About

[*Hyper*Sensors](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/HyperState) are part of the
[*Hyper*SLAM](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/HyperSLAM) framework and implement, based on
the [*Hyper*Variables](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/HyperVariables) repository, the physical sensor models (i.e.
absolute sensor, pinhole camera and inertial measurement unit models) employed
in *Hyper*SLAM. If you use this repository, please cite it as below.

## Installation

[*Hyper*Sensors](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/HyperSensors) depends on the
[*Hyper*Variables](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/HyperVariables) and
[*Hyper*State](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/HyperState) libraries and uses features from the
[C++20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20) standard (see
[link](https://askubuntu.com/questions/26498/how-to-choose-the-default-gcc-and-g-version) to update gcc and g++
alternatives). All dependencies aside from the ones contained in the `setup.sh` script are automatically fetched
during compilation. The compilation process itself (without additional compile flags) is as follows:

```
# Clone repository.
git clone https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/HyperSensors.git && cd HyperSensors/

# Run setup.
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo setup.sh

# Build repository.
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
